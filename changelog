Changes in 1.1.3
 * Added support for new infoschema system user in 8.0.4
 * Bumped server versions to 5.5.59, 5.6.39, 5.7.21, 8.0.4
 * Bumper cluster versions to 7.5.9, 7.6.4

Changes in 1.1.2 (2017-10-16)
 * Bumped server versions to 5.5.58, 5.6.38, 5.7.20
 * Bumped Shell 8.0 version to 8.0.3

Changes in 1.1.1 (2017-09-22)
 * Disable binlog for all entrypoint client commands (#87305)
   This was previously only done only for the script to set the root password,
   but should be done for all client commands, or group replication will fail
 * Add flag for logging to console (#87458)
   Setting -e MYSQL_LOG_CONSOLE=true will make the server log to console, so the
   server log is available through Docker's log interface. If /etc/my.cnf is
   mounted from the host system, this has no effect. On 8.0, this is the default
   behavior.
 * Ensure both MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWORD are set (#86982)
   Before, setting only one would cause the option to be silently ignored.
 * Read password file first and throw error if it is empty (#87025)
   Setting MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD to an empty string would be rejected, but
   setting it to a file with no content would be accepted. Both are now rejected.
 * MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD and MYSQL_ONETIME_PASSWORD are now set by default. (#87515)
   A password option no longer needs to be set explicitly. If none are set, a
   random, expired password is set.
 * Make root@$MYSQL_ROOT_HOST identical to root@localhost (#86945)
   If the MYSQL_ROOT_HOST variable is set we add an additional root user for
   the given host. This user was missing the PROXY privilege. We add the
   missing privilege so the users are identical.
 * MySQL Server 8.0 updated to 8.0.3-rc
 * MySQL Shell for 5.7 updated to 1.0.10

Changes in 1.1.0 (2017-07-24)
 * Fixed broken MYSQL_ONETIME_PASSWORD support (#86523)
   The functionality wasn't correctly updated when the entrypoint script was
   changed to only create the root@localhost user by default
 * Changed control files to be generated from a common template
   The control files for each version will be generated by swapping out the few
   commands that differ between server versions
 * Made PACKAGE_URL an ARG entry, to allow build-time changing
   The URL variables can be changed by supplying new ones with --build-arg at
   build time
 * Added basic healthcheck script
   Once database init is complete a flag file will be touched. If this file
   exists and mysqladmin ping succeeds, the container is reported as healthy,
   meaning it is ready for use
 * Database init will now use configured socket setting instead of hardcoded
   Using a hardcoded socket could cause init scripts to fail in confusing ways
   if the user customized the socket setting
 * Added MySQL Shell to supported images
   For 5.7 and 8.0, MySQL Shell is installed together with the server.

Known issues:
 * For existing databases created with older images/not with Docker, the
   healthcheck script will generate an "Access denied for healthchecker@localhost"
   message in the server log every time it runs. If connection throttling is
   enabled this could eventually cause the healthcheck to fail
